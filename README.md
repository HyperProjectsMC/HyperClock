# HyperClock Plugin

**HyperClock** is a Minecraft plugin that creates a global stopwatch and/or timer that can be fully controlled in-game through commands. With HyperClock, players and server administrators can easily start, pause, and reset time using the appropriate permissions or with OP. The plugin integrates with PlaceholderAPI and provides multiple placeholders, allowing the stopwatch and timer to be shown on scoreboards, tab lists, boss bars, or other UI elements. Perfect for events, minigames, and challenges where timing matters.
